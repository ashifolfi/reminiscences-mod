# Reminiscences Mod
A mod for SRB2 that ports old character mods to the latest version with tons of tweaks and new content.

## Development
Due to SRB2's ability to load folders, testing the mod during development is as easy as launching SRB2 using the following parameters on the command line:

```
-folder -file <path-to-reminskins.pk3> -folder <path-to-src-folder>
```

## Versioning
This mod uses the Major.Minor.Patch version structure.

----

**Major**: New characters, Ability changes, feature additions, etc.

**Minor**: Ability adjustments, Balance changes, etc.

**Patch**: Bug fixes, non player facing changes, etc.

----

Hopefully the above info explains how this generally works.


## NOTICE
**This mod is currently in an unfinished state with no stable releases!**

This code has not been battle tested and as such cannot be considered stable. Hell some things just straight up aren't even finished. Please keep this in mind.

## FAQ

### Q: What happened to Team Reminiscenes?
A: It has disbanded. The members either left SRB2 modding or had no desire to work on the mod.

### Q: Why did this take so long to come out?
A: A combination of a lack of motivation, a lack of time, and the loss of a ton of development builds. I had to really dig to gather all of this together.

### Q: What about the MB?
A: MB releases will happen every now and then when enough changes/fixes/adjustments are gathered to justify a release.
